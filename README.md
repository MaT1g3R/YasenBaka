## Self Host
To self host yasen, you will need those packages installed on your system:
* Python3.6+: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Python3.5 and below is not supported
* FFmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/
* SQLite3: https://www.sqlite.org/

In addition, you will need to execute the following command to install required libraries:

First cd into the directory where yasen is located, then:

```bash
pip install -Ur requirements.txt
```

Make a copy of `YasenBaka/data/sample_db` in the `YasenBaka/data/` directory and rename it to `yasen_db`

Make a copy of `YasenBaka/config/sample_config.json` in the `YasenBaka/config/` directory and rename it to `config.json`. Then you will need to fill out the required config values and api keys. I am not responsible for helping you obtaining any of the api keys.

Finally to run, do:
```bash
python3 yasen-baka.py
```
